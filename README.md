If you want to build it - need teensy (2.0 is cheapest, ~6$ on ali, 3+ should work, but it has much better analog reads, so will need to modify capacitive sensor), few resistors, LED's and arduino. I also used stepup to power red LED's but it's just for more fun, not really needed.
Check ino file comments for readout pins.
